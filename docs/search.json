    "text": "Frequency resolution is the size of the smallest frequency for which details in the frequency response and the spectrum can be resolved by the estimate. For example, a resolution of 0.1 Hz means that the frequency response variations at frequency intervals at or below 0.1 Hz are not resolved. For any model developed in the course of a data analysis project, frequency resolution sets a limit in the uncertainty in the model estimate.\nLet us suppose to sample an analog band-limited signal \\(x(t)\\) with bandwidth \\(B\\) Hz with a sampling frequency \\(f_s\\) over a total sample period \\(T_r\\) s. Let \\(T_s=1/f_s\\) be the sampling interval.\nThe minimum resolvable frequency is:\n\\[\nf_{\\text{min}}=\\frac{1}{T_r}=\\frac{1}{NT_s}\n\\tag{1}\\]\nwhere \\(N\\) is the number of samples of the signal \\(x(t)\\). If the sampling frequency \\(f_s\\) is chosen to be \\(2B\\), the maximum resolvable frequency is:\n\\[\nf_{\\text{max}}=B=\\frac{f_s}{2}\n\\]\nThus the number of frequencies that can be resolved from \\(f_{\\text{min}}\\) to \\(f_{\\text{max}}\\) is\n\\[\nN_f=\\frac{f_{\\text{max}}-f_{\\text{min}}}{\\Delta f}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\Delta f\\) is the frequency resolution. Since \\(\\Delta f=f_{\\text{min}}\\), we also have:\n\\[\nN_f=\\dfrac{\\dfrac{f_s}{2}-\\dfrac{f_s}{N}}{\\dfrac{f_s}{N}}=\\frac{N}{2}-1\n\\]\nThis implies that will be \\(N/2\\) discrete frequencies from \\(0\\) to \\(f_{\\text{max}}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReminder\n\n\n\nThe frequency, \\(f\\) in cycles per sample of a discrete-time sinusoidal signal is restricted to values in the interval \\(-1/2\\leq f\\leq1/2\\). This is because any sequence resulting from a sinusoidal signal with frequency \\(\\vert f\\vert&gt;1/2\\) comes to be identical to the sequence obtained from a sinusoidal signal with frequency \\(f_0:f=f_0+m,\\vert f_0\\vert\\leq1/2\\):\n\\[\n\\cos 2\\pi fn=\\cos[2\\pi (f_0+m)\\,n]=\\cos(2\\pi f_0n)+\\cos(2\\pi mn)=\\cos(2\\pi f_0n)\n\\]\nThe highest rate of oscillation of sinusoidal signals is \\(f_0=1/2\\):\n\\[\n\\cos(2\\pi f_0n)=\\cos\\left(2\\pi\\frac{1}{2}n\\right)=\\cos(\\pi n)=(-1)^n\n\\]\nThis is indeed the sequence with the highest conceivable rate of change: at every time instant, the output sample flips with respect to the previous one.\nA sinusoidal signal is periodic if its frequency is expressed as a rational number; a complex signal arising from the additive combination of periodical sinusoidal signals is periodic with period equal to the least common integer multiple of their periods.\n\n\nThe phenomenon of amplitude ambiguity consists in ambiguous and false amplitudes occurring in the spectrum of \\(x(t)\\) whenever the total sample period \\(T_r\\) (the record time) is not an integer multiple of all of the signal’s contributory periods. That is, false or ambiguous amplitudes will occur at frequencies that are immediately adjacent to the actual frequency and spill from it somehow in its neighborhood.\nFor aperiodic signals, \\(T_r\\) theoretically must be infinite. For complex periodic signals, \\(T_r\\) must be equal to the least common integer multiple of all the periods contained in the signal. When this condition cannot be fulfilled, windowing is the elective method to minimize the effect of amplitude ambiguity (not used herein). Application of the DFT or FFT to an aperiodic signal implicitly assumes that the signal is infinite in length and formed by repeating the signal of length \\(T_r\\) an infinite number of times. This leads to discontinuities in the amplitude that occur at each integer multiple of \\(T_r\\). These discontinuities are step-like, which introduce false amplitudes that decrease around the main frequencies.\nThe method of spectral analysis based on using the FFT algorithm is summarized below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod of spectral analysis\n\n\n\n\nConvert the fft spectrum Y of a signal X to the single-sided amplitude spectrum. Because the fft function includes a scaling factor N between the original and the transformed signals, rescale Y by dividing by N.\nTake the complex magnitude of the fft spectrum. The two-sided amplitude spectrum P2, where the spectrum in the positive frequencies is the complex conjugate of the spectrum in the negative frequencies, has half the peak amplitudes of the time-domain signal.\nTo convert to the single-sided spectrum, take the first half of the two-sided spectrum P2. Multiply the spectrum in the positive frequencies by 2. You do not need to multiply P1(1) and P1(end) by 2 because these amplitudes correspond to the zero and Nyquist frequencies, respectively, and they do not have the complex conjugate pairs in the negative frequencies.\nDefine the frequency domain f for the single-sided spectrum.\n\n\n\nThe following code chunk implements the method in MATLAB.\nfs = 16;   % sampling frequency, Hz\nTs = 1/fs; % sampling interval, s\nT  = 8;    % sample period, s\n\nt  = (0:Ts:T-Ts); % time domain, s\nN  = length(t);   % number of samples\n\nf1 = 2.9375;      % frequency component 1, Hz\nf2 = 3;           % frequency component 2, Hz\nf3 = 3.0625;      % frequency component 3, Hz\n\nx1 = cos(t.*(2*pi*f1)); % sinusoid 1\nx2 = cos(t.*(2*pi*f2)); % sinusoid 2\nx3 = cos(t.*(2*pi*f3)); % sinusoid 3\nx4 = x1 + x2 + x3;      % additive combination\nX  = [x1; x2; x3; x4];\n\nP              = fft(X, N);         % FFT calculation\nP2             = abs(P/N);          % scaling by N     \nP1             = P2(:, 1:N/2+1);  \nP1(:, 2:end-1) = 2*P1(:, 2:end-1); \nY              = P1(:, 1:end-1);    % single-side spectrum\nf              = (0:N/2-1).*(fs/N); % frequency domain, Hz\nAs outlined above, the amplitudes of simple or complex periodic waveforms will be accurately represented in the DFT when \\(f_s&gt;2f_{\\text{max}}\\) and \\(T_r = mT_1\\), where \\(m=1,2,\\cdots\\). \\(T_1\\) is the fundamental period (\\(T_1=1/f_1\\)). This implies that \\(N=mf_s/f_1\\). If \\(T\\) is not an integer multiple of \\(T_1\\), leakage will occur in the DFT. This appears as amplitudes at \\(f_1\\) spilling over into other adjacent frequencies.\nAs an example, consider a signal expected to have three frequency peaks at 2.875 Hz, 3 Hz, 3.125 Hz (three sinusoidal signals with amplitude one). The sampling frequency is \\(f_s=16\\) Hz and the sample period is \\(T=8\\) s (\\(N=128\\)). The component at 2.875 Hz is observed exactly for 23 periods, the component at 3 Hz for 24 periods, and the component at 3.125 Hz for 25 periods. The resolution calculated according to Equation 1 is 0.125 Hz. The single-sided spectrum of the signal is shown in Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Single-sided spectrum of the periodic signal composed of three components at 2.875 Hz, 3 Hz, 3.125 Hz; sample period: 8 s. For the sake of visualization the frequency interval shown is limited to 2.5-3.5 Hz.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, if the signal is expected to have three frequency peaks at 2.9375 Hz, 3 Hz, 3.0625 Hz, we enjoy a frequency resolution of 0.0625 Hz, hence a time period \\(T_r=16\\) s is needed for avoiding amplitude ambiguity, corresponding to \\(N=256\\) samples, see Figure 3. On the other hand, without any adjustment in the sample period, the phenomenon of amplitude ambiguity prevents us from faithfully detecting the three signal components, see Figure 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Single-sided spectrum of the periodic signal composed of three components at 2.9375 Hz, 3 Hz, 3.0625 Hz; sample period: 8 s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Single-sided spectrum of the periodic signal composed of three components at 2.9375 Hz, 3 Hz, 3.0625 Hz; sample period: 16 s.\n\n\n\nTo conclude: whereas the sampling frequency sets the time resolution of the spectral analysis, the sample period occupies a central place in setting its frequency resolution. The sample period being the same, just increasing the sampling frequency simply increases the number of samples by the same ratio, leaving their ratio unaltered. The only way to increase the frequency resolution is to increase the sample period."
